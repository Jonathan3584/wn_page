                <p class="attorney-body-text">
                    Richard concentrates his practice in the fields of estate planning and administration and income taxation. He is also an expert in the incorporation and organization of small businesses and non-profits. Richard's research skills, knowledge, and experience in taxation and estate matters allow him to provide expert advice in those fields, and he is often called upon by CPAs and other attorneys. Richard joined the firm in 1985 and became a partner in 1991. Richard Nordan was born in Wiesbaden, West Germany, while his father was serving in the Air Force, but his family roots are in Smithfield, North Carolina. Richard graduated from North Carolina State University with honors in 1978, and became a Certified Public Accountant in 1980. After several years of practice in this field, he returned to school, obtaining his Juris Doctor degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is a member of the North Carolina State Bar, the North Carolina and Wake County Bar Associations, and the North Carolina Association of Certified Public Accountants. His deep interest and involvement in politics has led him to serve as counsel, campaign treasurer, and advisor to several Judges of the North Carolina Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, and to the current Attorney General. Richard's interests include bluegrass music and North Carolina's tobacco heritage.
